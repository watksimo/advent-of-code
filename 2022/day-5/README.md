<h1>Day 5: Supply Stacks</h1>

* Providing the stacks not in the obvious load direction added a little time. My solution is bad, as it assumes the dictionary is ordered by it's keys, which is not guaranteed (just happens to be the case).
* Got done over in part 2 because I'd modified the dict in place in part 1, so I lazily just reloaded the file instead of copying the dict correctly as the load time was so low.
